3753;realDonaldTrump;In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!;;11:00:47;2016-05-30;;4240;14835;;
3754;realDonaldTrump;Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.;;10:41:49;2016-05-30;;6493;18152;;

3766;realDonaldTrump;I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!;;20:28:48;2016-05-28;;5308;17466;;
3767;realDonaldTrump;"The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- &amp; I'm beating her.";;20:28:22;2016-05-28;;5279;16742;;

5689;realDonaldTrump;Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.;;14:28:59;2016-02-03;;7655;17469;;

5691;realDonaldTrump;The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud;;14:10:53;2016-02-03;;3324;7774;;
5692;realDonaldTrump;Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.;;14:07:25;2016-02-03;;3697;8275;;
5693;realDonaldTrump;During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.;;13:56:48;2016-02-03;;3383;7042;;
5694;realDonaldTrump;Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!;;13:47:33;2016-02-03;;6575;13948;;
